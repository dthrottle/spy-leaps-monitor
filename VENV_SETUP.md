# Virtual Environment Setup Complete! âœ…

Your Python virtual environment has been created and all dependencies are installed.

## Activate the Virtual Environment

### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### On Windows:
```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Verify Installation

After activation, you should see `(venv)` prefix in your terminal:
```bash
(venv) your-prompt $
```

Test the installation:
```bash
python --version
pip list
```

## Run the Application

With the virtual environment activated:

```bash
# Quick start (downloads data and launches app)
python start.py

# Or just launch the app
streamlit run src/main.py

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Deactivate

When you're done:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Using the Run Script

The `run.sh` script automatically uses the virtual environment:

```bash
./run.sh start      # Quick start
./run.sh app        # Launch app
./run.sh test       # Run tests
```
